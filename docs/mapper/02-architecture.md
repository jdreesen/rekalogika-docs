This chapter describes the architecture of the library.

## Components

### Transformers

Transforms a source variable to the target variable. A transformer class
provides the list of the supported source to target mappings, as well as
the logic for transforming the source to the target.

### Main Transformer

The main transformer is the entry point of the library. It is responsible
for finding the transformer that supports the source to target mapping,
and transforming the source to the target using that transformer.

### Mapping Table Factory

Creates the mapping table from the list of the transformers.

The mapping table is a list of the supported source to target type, mapped to
the transformer suitable for the task. It is used by the main transformer to
find the correct transformer for transforming the source to the target type.

### Mapper

A fa√ßade for the main transformer. A user-facing interface that is used directly
by the caller.

### Symfony Property Info

The library uses the Symfony Property Info component to list the properties of
the source and target variables, and to query their types. This library uses
the `Type` objects returned by the Symfony Property Info component as the
means of describing the types of the source and target variables.

### Symfony Property Access

The library uses the Symfony Property Access component to read from and write to
the source and target variables. It is used by the main transformer and the
