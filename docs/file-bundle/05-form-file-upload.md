title: File Uploads Using FilePond
---

This chapter describes how to easily create a form for uploading files.

:::info Preparation

To enable this feature, you need to install the package
`rekalogika/file-filepond`:

```bash
composer require rekalogika/file-filepond
```

This package depends on [file-bundle](installation) and
[temporary-url-bundle](../temporary-url-bundle), so if you don't use Symfony
Flex and you haven't installed them yet, you need to read their installation
instructions and complete the installation first.
